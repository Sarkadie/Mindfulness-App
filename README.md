Base Cordova Project +
- basic Framework 7 app setup with one additional page. 
- Content-Security-Policy with Google Fonts Included

This app is meant to be used as something simple to focus on when you need a breather during your day. I've dropped two pins in the map section that show two areas that are (usually) quiet and calm. (The plant hallway can be busy in between classes but I enjoy the plants regardless.)
There is also a section in the app that will encourage the user to navigate a ball using their device orientation to keep it within the ring. This is a simple activity that doesn't take much thought, and is meant to be used as something like a meditation activity.
